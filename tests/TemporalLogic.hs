-- TODO
-- Properties in this file have different types.
-- It's important to agree on the representation type.
--
-- It may be a bit hard, because some elements from logic are
-- provided by QC, while others have to be defined by us.
-- For example, connectives like implication and always are
-- provided by us, and forAll is in QuickCheck.
--
-- This makes it hard to combine, becase for this language to be
-- compositional like logic is we need to make everything accept
-- a QuickCheck predicate, which may not be possible or compatible
-- with out goals.

-- Important question: because this FRP implement uses CPS,
-- it is stateful, and sampling twice in one time period
-- is not necessarily the same as sampling once. This means that
-- tauApp, or next, might not work correctly. It's important to
-- see what is going on there... :(
